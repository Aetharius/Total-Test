<foreignObject x="113.5" y="105" width="210" height="400">
  <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
       style="font-family: 'Signika Negative', sans-serif; font-weight: 300; font-size: 8.1px; color: #fff; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.3;">

    <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
      The UAE’s energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation as the country shifts towards a more diverse, sustainable and self-sufficient energy model. In 2023, the country updated its national energy strategy to triple the targeted contribution of renewable sources to the national energy mix and earmarked investments of up to AED 200 billion [USD 54.4 billion] in generation capacity by 2030 to satisfy growing internal demand.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
      Guided by the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, the UAE is reinforcing its commitment to decarbonisation and achieving net-zero emissions, and including more nuclear, solar and other renewable sources such as waste-to-energy and hydrogen to reach a mix of 44% clean energy, 38% natural gas, 12% clean coal and 6% nuclear energy.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">OIL</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
      The UAE holds the world’s seventh-largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 113 billion barrels, with approximately 96% located in Abu Dhabi. In 2024, the country produced around 2.9 million bopd, but capacity is being ramped up to reach 5 million bopd by 2027 to meet rising global energy demand. ADNOC is driving the effort by leveraging advanced digital technologies, whose huge potential is demonstrated by the 25% boost in output obtained in the offshore Satah Al Razboot following the deployment of remote monitoring, smart well operations and AI-supported production management systems.

    <p style="margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">NATURAL GAS</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
      The UAE’s 8.21 tcm (289.9 tcf) natural gas reserves are the seventh-largest globally, yet it imports 56.6 mcm (2 bcf) of gas per day from Qatar via the Dolphin pipeline, mainly to supply power plants and desalination facilities. The country aims to be self-sufficient in gas supply by 2030 and has several initiatives under way to boost production, such as the Hail and Ghasha sour gas mega-project, which is expected to add more than 42.5 mcm (1.5 bcf) per day to the domestic gas supply.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">RENEWABLES</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
      To reach its target of triple the contribution of renewable energy by 2030, the UAE is making substantial investments in renewable energies. Installed generation capacity is projected to reach 9 GW in 2025, with notable contributions from the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, the world's largest single-site solar park, which aims to bring 5 GW into production by 2030, and the Al Ajban Solar PV project in Abu Dhabi, which will be producing 1.5 GW by 2026. The UAE is also in the process of ramping up its hydrogen production to 1.4 million tonnes per year by 2031 and constructing waste-to-energy plants, of which the 30-MW Sharjah facility is an early example.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0; font-weight: bold;">NUCLEAR</p>
    <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0;">
      The UAE has embraced nuclear energy as a clean and dependable power source. In September 2024, the country launched the fourth and final unit of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, the first multi-unit facility in the region, whose combined capacity of 5.6 GW is capable of generating 40 TWh of electricity per year, or about 25% of the UAE's total internal demand. The plant prevents 22.4 million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide emissions each year. Looking ahead, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation is exploring the construction of additional small modular reactors.
